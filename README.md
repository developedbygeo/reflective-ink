<!-- A React-based, fully responsive website that uses JSON data and combines creative & responsive design along with, high-end audio gear.

This project was a lovely opportunity to follow a provided, structured Figma design and bring to life. The main challenge was implementing the design and its nuances, with drastic changes to the layout in terms of responsiveness, adding a certain degree of complexity, especiallly when trying to maintain DRY code.

It implements lazy loading and it is based on TypeScript, React Router, Redux Toolkit, Styled Components and Framer Motion. For a detailed overview, please have a look at the [**Features**](#features) & [**Tech**](#tech) section.

**Note**: All of the image assets, along with the design files were provided by Frontend Mentor, as part of the [_Audiophile e-commerce website_](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/audiophile-ecommerce-website-C8cuSd_wx) challenge. -->
